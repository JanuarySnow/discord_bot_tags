## Verify Your Game Files

Your base game files don’t seem to match what Wabbajack expects to find. Verify your files through Steam via following these steps:

1. Close Wabbajack
2. Open your Steam Library tab
3. Right click the game title that you are modding
4. Select Properties
5. Select Installed Files
6. Select Verify Integrity of Local Files
7. Launch Wabbajack

Type `/tags tag: update_modlist` for more information on the final step. And no, you won’t lose your download progress for the Modlist.
