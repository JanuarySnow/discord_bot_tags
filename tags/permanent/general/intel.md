## Intel Powerdraw Bug

12900, 13900 and 14900 are all victims of Intel power draw bug

Its not a wj issue, its your cpu slowly degrading the amount of power it can draw without causing crashing
anything else that pushes any real stress on it will similarly cause crashing if your clock multiplier is too high.

fix: Gotta limit your clock multiplier to 54x or lower
